# electric-car-charging-robot
This is a repo of files from an automatic electric car charging robot that I was designing with my friends Eddie Tian and Grace Wu before COVID19. This was done for a design course assignment with specific requirements, which are alluded to in our Project Proposal. 

For a summary of our plan, see Reports/Project Proposal.pdf. For a summary of the state of the robot as we left it before COVID19, see Reports/State of Robot as of March 2020.pdf. In the same file, there is also a list of the work breakdown between myself, Grace, and Eddie (I did not write all the files in this repo - I'm just uploading them here as a record of our work).
